### Use Case : TODO App

For the purpose of this project, I spent almost 3 days to figure out a simple usecase to deploy. Every single search on the "Blockchain Use Cases" or "Smart Contracts Use Cases" would lead to either financial related topics, voting or identification. It is funny(or maybe disapoiting?) that I asked this question from my new Google Home Mini and the result was again the same(She told me ```real state, voting and identity```). Now, I really did not wanted to these use case which has been done multiple times in different sessions of this program and in this short period of time, I was not able to solve any real issue in the mentioned cases. Yet, todo cases has been very useful for me in the matter of education. This simple smart contract at leat can solve a very basic simple issue.

#### What's next ? 
For this ```ToDo``` Smart Contract, I am going to develop a front-end and finlize it as a ```ToDo dApp``` .
